//! Time management heuristics and decision making.
//!
//! In a match, a chess engine is usually given a budget of time for the entire game, and it is the
//! engine's duty to decide how much to use when making each move.
//! More sophisticated engines do an analysis of the position and guess its complexity, giving
//! themselves more time in positions which are more complex.
//! For now, Fiddler is not so intelligent, and instead rations time to itself indiscriminately.
