//! Material values for each piece.
//!
//! Every piece is assigned a numeric value in centipawns (cp).
//! Under normal conditions, a centipawn defined as 100cp; however, the consequences of tuning have
//! yielded values for pawns slightly off of that mark.
//!
//! In traditional chess, pawns are worth 100cp, knights and bishops are worth 300cp, rooks are
//! worth 500cp, and queens are worth 900cp each.
//! However, any chess player worth their salt might tell you that bishops are a little more
//! valuable than knights.
//! Empirically, the engine agrees.
