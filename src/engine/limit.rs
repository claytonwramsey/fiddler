//! Search limiting.
//!
//! It makes little sense to wait until a search decides that it's done, as it's hard to predict
//! when said search will be done.
//! The code in here is used to create limits to how long we can search, so that we don't have to
//! wait forever.
//!
//! A search limit is an inherently concurrent structure - much care must be taken to avoid
//! deadlocking.
